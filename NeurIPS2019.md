From the NeurIPS [ML4PS workshop](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/) there are some excellent papers that we might not have seen/registered because of our domain experience. Please feel free to go through all the accepted papers [here](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/#papers). There are many contributions in the field of astrophysics that might be of interest to MELT.
